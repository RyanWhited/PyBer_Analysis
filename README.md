# PyBer Ride Share Analysis Challenge
## Summary
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

  - The highest amount of rides comes from our Urban area and the furter we get away from the heart of the city the fewer rides are taken. 
  - Fares are higher for rural and suburan rides compared to urban. This could be because rural and suburban rides travel much further distances and possibly are traveling into the urban area. Urban fares are smaller as destinations are much more condensed.
  - This also shows that residents within the urban area more than likely don't have their own transportation and need to utilize the PyBer rideshare service versus those in suburban and rual areas who more than likely have their own vehicles to get around.
