# PyBer Ride Share Analysis Challenge
## Summary
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
### PyBer Summary DataFrame Results

  - The highest amount of rides comes from our Urban area and the furter we get away from the heart of the city usage drops. 
  - Fares are higher for rural and suburban rides compared to urban. This could be because rural and suburban rides travel much further distances and possibly are traveling into the urban area. Urban fares are smaller as destinations are much more condensed.
  - This also shows that residents within the urban area more than likely don't have their own transportation and need to utilize the PyBer rideshare service versus those in suburban and rural areas who more than likely have their own vehicles to get around. 
  
### Total Fare by City Type Results

  - This line graph clearly shows that the bulk of PyBer's fares come from the Urban area.
  - There's an identical upward spike across all city types towards the end of February. This could reflect a regional event that riders utilize PyBer for from all areas. 
  - The beginning of the year is slow across all three city types. 
## Summary

Based on these results here are three business recommendations for the CEO for addressing disparities among the city types:

  1. To help increase the amount of PyBer rideshare usage from the suburban and rural areas consider doing targeted marketing for these regions to help build awareness about the service.
  2. Consider running promotions at the beginning of the year to increase usage across all city types. 
  3. As usage rises be sure to focus on recruiting new drivers to make sure that the demand is met.
